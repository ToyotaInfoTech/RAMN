Challenge RAMN A-1
Tags: RE, USB
Difficulty: Easy
Attachment: ECUA_REDACTED_FLAGS.hex (source code of ECU A with redacted flags)
Prompt: Here is the firmware for ECU A (with redacted flags for challenges RAMN A-1 and RAMN A-2). Can you recover the password for the USB interface?

----------------------------------------

Challenge RAMN A-2
Tags: PWN, USB, OSINT
Difficulty: Medium

Prompt: What is this, a memory dump for ants?
(Note: This challenge follows RAMN A-1. It can be solved using only the USB serial interface and ECU A’s screen. You can assume most of the source code is unchanged from RAMN’s GitHub, and that all memory-dumping features are disabled.).
